## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### SMS Functions Added

**1. `sendOrderSms(order)`**
- Triggered when order is placed
- Sends: "Your [service] order received. Tracking: [ID]"
- Uses user's phone number from order

**2. `sendStatusUpdateSms(order)`**
- Triggered when order status changes
- Sends: "Your order status: [status]. Tracking: [ID]"
- Uses contact_phone from order

**3. Delivery SMS** (in shipment endpoint)
- Triggered when status = 'delivered'
- Sends: "Package delivered! Tracking: [ID]"
- Uses sender_phone from shipment

### Integration Points
- All SMS calls use existing `sendSmsMessage()` from sms-utils.js
- All SMS calls are non-blocking (async)
- Failed SMS don't block order processing
- Proper error logging for debugging

## ✨ Server Configuration on Startup

When server starts, it logs:

```
=== EMAIL CONFIGURATION CHECK ===
RESEND_API_KEY: ✓ SET / ✗ NOT SET
SMTP_HOST: ✓ SET / ✗ NOT SET
EMAIL_USER: ✓ SET / ✗ NOT SET
✓ Resend client initialised OR
✓ SMTP mailer initialised (Gmail)

=== TWILIO CONFIGURATION CHECK ===
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: ✓ SET / ✗ NOT SET
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: ✓ SET / ✗ NOT SET
✓ Twilio client initialized
```

This helps diagnose configuration issues immediately.
